Brief Description:

Scrabble:
There are 100 letters from a pile. Each player will have 7 letetrs to create a word. Each letter that is used will allow the player to gain a certain number of points. After a player has created a word, the letters they have used will be replaced by the remaining letters in the pile. If a letter is placed at a certain place on the board, his/her points may be multiplied depending on the situation. The game ends when there are no more letters in the pile or no one is able to create a word. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.
